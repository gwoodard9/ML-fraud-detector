#ML Fraud Detection System
##Overview
This machine learning project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using a dataset of financial transactions. By applying supervised learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, we identify fraudulent behavior and improve transaction security. The system uses SMOTE to address class imbalance, ensuring a robust model that performs well on imbalanced data.

##Features
Fraud Detection: Detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the data for model training.
Class Imbalance Handling: Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset and improve model performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, essential metrics for fraud detection systems.
Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation to ensure model generalizability.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
imblearn: For handling class imbalance with SMOTE.
Jupyter Notebooks (optional): For exploratory analysis.
